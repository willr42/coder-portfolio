          Boy that was long. I definitely think the Mars Trilogy is Important, in the capitalised
          meaning of the word for one thing, it inspired at least two billionaires to look to Ares
          as a solution rather than think about solving Earth's ongoing environmental catastrophe.
          Which funnily enough is the situation Mars finds itself in at the start of Green Mars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Mars and Earth are reeling from a failed uprising, brought on by the longevity
          treatments that extend human life - possibly indefinitely? It's obvious that these
          treatments are equal parts inciting incident and plot device to ensure the First Hundred,
          who we're emotionally invested in (if not by any emotional connection, then at least by
          400+ pages of exposition) to continue to live and be around for the next stage of Mars
          settlement, but it's funny that such a fundamental technology that could easily warrant
          its own individual novel is left as background detail here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The longevity treatments, though, actually help combat KSR's problem with weak character
          work - there's something about the internal voice that feels more like you're reading the
          stage directions for how a character's feeling, rather than... how a character is feeling.
          But by using the same characters we already know, he's able to shortcut a lot of the work
          that would have to be done by new faces.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          This text is also geologically obsessed. And it makes sense, because the Mars we're in is
          transitioning from one of geology to biology, but there's still a little too much "let's
          list the places in Mars we're passing" for me. Possibly this would have been easier with a
          physical copy with easier access to the map.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is really the ideal 3.5 for me, as I think 4 is a little too strong, mainly due to
          the length. I'm surprised such a weighty tome made it out when I think of this as
          relatively early in KSR's career. A judicious editor would have bumped this up to a full
          4. There are moments where time feels to be repeating itself - but I think this is because
          that's how it feels for the characters too.
        </p>
        <p>Bring on the final chapter - but I think I need a break first.</p>

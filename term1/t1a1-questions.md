7. Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.
   For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way. (Word count guide: 200 words max) Conduct research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches. (Word count guide: 400 - 600 words)

   - trading of shares on the stock exchange OR crypto-currencies

8. Explain control flow, using examples from the Python programming language
9. Explain the difference between type coercion and type conversion. Are either of these used in Python?
10. Explain data types, using examples
11. Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”

- Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem
- Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified

12. Identify and explain the error in the code snippet below that is preventing correct execution of the program

```python
celsius = input()

farenheit = (celsius*9/5)+32

print(f"The result is {farenheit}.")
```

13. The code snippet below looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

```python
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i<arr.len()-1) and (arr[i] < arr[i+1]):
	i += 1
print(i)
	arr[i] = arr[i+1]
	arr[i+1] = arr[i]
```

14. Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:

    1. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations
    2. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart

15. Write pseudocode OR Python code for the following problem: You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.
16. ACME Corporation are hiring a new junior developer, as part of their hiring criteria they've created a "coding skill score" based on the specific competencies they require for this role; the more important the skill is for ACME corp, the more points it contributes to the "coding skill score" The skills are weighted as follows:

- Python (1)
- Ruby (2)
- Bash (4)
- Git (8)
- HTML (16)
- TDD (32)
- CSS (64)
- JavaScript (128) ​

Write a program that allows a user to input their skills and then tells them

- Their overall "coding skill score"
- Skills they may want to learn, and how much each one would improve their score
